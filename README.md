## **Overview**
A simple full-stack application for managing tasks, built with .NET for the backend and React for the frontend. It allows users to:
- Create tasks by providing a name and description.
- View all tasks that have been created.

This project showcases the integration of a .NET Web API with a React frontend to manage a basic data workflow.
